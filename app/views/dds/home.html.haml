		%h2 HOW WE WORK WITH YOU

		Before any solutions are recommended, we run an analysis to determine an organizationâ€™s
		current status and level in relation to ICT maturity. We go a step further and determine the
		direction that an organization is looking to adopt; for instance, the complete automation of a
		certain level of service offering and the impacts that this milestone will have on the service
		offering and the organization in general. This then enables Double Dimensions to establish the
		gap analysis and thereafter craft effective solutions in terms of software and hardware
		knowledge and capacity and most importantly organizational change.  
		Our solutions also lean heavily on the business Vs ICT strategy. We offer software and hardware
		model proposals, like cloud computing, Server services, e.tc that are cost effective and
